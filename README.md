## Case description

A bot is an autonomous program that interacts with people or computer systems in a predictable way. The logic behind a bot is designed and programmed by the bot creator, often with the help of tools like the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft also has other AI services, included in Azure Cognitive Services, that can enhance the capabilities of your bots.

QnA Maker is one of the AI services that can help a bot answer your users' natural language questions by matching them with the best possible answers from your knowledge base.

## What is the QnA Maker

QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that easily creates a natural conversational layer over your data. It can be used to find the most appropriate answer for any given natural language input, from your custom knowledge base (KB) of information.

A client application for QnA Maker is any conversational application that communicates with a user in natural language to answer a question. Examples of client applications include social media apps, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications.
